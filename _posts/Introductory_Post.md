title: Introductory Post

---

Hi! I am Michael Kheifetz and would like to introduce everyone to my Data Science blog. Just a quick introduction to myself, I was a Tax Accountant in my previous life but have always been extremely passionate about Mathematics, Statistics and problem solving. This love for mathematical thinking and a general love for anything related to data brought me to the Data Science world. I recently completed a Data Science Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly, which taught me about many of the fundamentals of the subject such as coding, Bayesian & Frequentist Statistics, Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Time Series Modeling and much more.

My purpose in creating this blog will be to post things that I find to be particularly exciting and important in Data Science. I intend for the posts to vary in style, some will be more practical with pieces of code, some might have some theory or conceptual discussions of some interesting topics, and for some, a mixture of both. One thing I can assure, it will be something that I am passionate about and believe to be important and relevant enough to post. Without further adieu, I want to welcome all readers to my blog and thank you very much for visiting! Hope you enjoy it. You can contact me with any questions and comments regarding my posts at mkheifetz@gmail.com or on my Linkedin account.

Looking forward to posting some cool stuff!
